- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and optimization
- ‚úÖ Enhanced navigation and productivity tools
- ‚úÖ AI assistance (requires Copilot setup)
- ‚úÖ Session management and persistence

### üîÑ First-Time Setup

When you first launch Neovim:

1. **Plugins will install automatically** - this may take a few minutes
2. **Copilot setup** (if you want AI features):
   - Run `:Copilot setup` and follow authentication steps
   - Authentication is optional - config works without it
3. **Mason tools** - LSP servers and formatters will install as needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Notices

These are normal and don't affect functionality:
- `[Copilot.lua] LSP client failed to start` - until you authenticate Copilot
- Some plugins may show setup messages on first run

### üîß Current Adjustments

- **File Opening Performance**: Optimized for instant file access
  - Files now open immediately without delay in neo-tree
  - Heavy plugins load after file display for smooth experience
  - File size optimizations prevent lag with large files
  - Syntax highlighting loads intelligently based on file size
- **Key Navigation**: Optimized for zero lag
  - `j`/`k` keys now have instant response (no timeout delays)
  - 5-line movement moved to `Alt+j`/`Alt+k` to avoid conflicts
  - Window navigation on `Ctrl+j`/`Ctrl+k` without interference
- **Notification System**: Using simple, reliable print-based notifications instead of nvim-notify
  - All health reminders and notifications work perfectly
  - Auto-notifications for breaks, hydration, posture, and eye rest are active
  - Manual health commands fully functional (`<leader>hd`, `<leader>hb`, etc.)
  - System prioritizes stability and compatibility over fancy UI

## üåü Philosophy

This configuration is built on the principle that great code comes from great developers, and great developers take care of themselves. It's not just about writing code faster - it's about sustaining a long, healthy, and productive career in software development.

Your health matters. Your productivity matters. And this Neovim setup makes sure both are taken care of.

Happy coding! üí™üöÄ
